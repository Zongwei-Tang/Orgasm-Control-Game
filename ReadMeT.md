  - Use the **revised README** if you’re targeting a niche audience (e.g., adult content communities) or distributing privately where explicit context is acceptable.
- **Check Platform Guidelines**: If hosting on a public platform, review their content policies to ensure the README complies, especially if leaning into the adult-oriented purpose.
- **User Feedback**: If possible, gather input from your target users to see if they prefer a subtle or explicit description.

If you want to blend elements of both versions or need further tweaks (e.g., more explicit, less explicit, or tailored for a specific platform), let me know, and I can refine it further!
